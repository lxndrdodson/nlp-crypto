# Unit 12â€”Tales from the Crypto

![Stock Sentiment](Images/sentimental.jpeg)

## Background

There's been a lot of hype in the news lately about cryptocurrency, so you want to take stock, so to speak, of the latest news headlines regarding Bitcoin and Ethereum to get a better feel for the current public sentiment around each coin.

This project required use of natural language processing to analyze the sentiment in the most recent articles about Bitcoin and Ethereum. 

Complete the following tasks:

1. [Sentiment Analysis](#Sentiment-Analysis):
    I applied the news api to pull articles about each coin
    
2. [Natural Language Processing](#Natural-Language-Processing):
    This section required the use of NLTK to tokenize the text for each coin. Looking at the ngrams and word frequency for each coin, I was able to generate word clouds to summarize the articles exhibited in the notebook. 

3. [Named Entity Recognition](#Named-Entity-Recognition): 
    I built a named entity recognition model for both coins using SpaCy.
